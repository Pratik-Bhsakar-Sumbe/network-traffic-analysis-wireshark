Network traffic analysis lab using Wireshark – examining TCP, UDP, and HTTP protocols for packet-level understanding and troubleshooting fundamentals.


# 📡 Networking Lab – Wireshark Analysis

## Overview
This repository documents my hands-on network traffic analysis performed using Wireshark as part of my academic lab work.

The objective was to capture and analyze real-time network packets and understand protocol-level communication.

---

## Protocols Analyzed
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

---

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Packet structure analysis
- TCP 3-way handshake observation
- Request-response cycle in HTTP
- Difference between connection-oriented and connectionless protocols
- Identifying source/destination IP and ports
- Basic troubleshooting using packet inspection

---

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Kali Linux / Linux Environment
- Test web traffic for HTTP analysis

---

## Industry Relevance
Wireshark is widely used in:
- Network troubleshooting
- Performance monitoring
- Cybersecurity investigations
- Incident response
- Packet-level debugging

This lab strengthened my foundational understanding of network communication and security analysis.
